# Build something you never thought you could

I’ll be honest in terms of how long I have been programming consistently; there are probably many other people more qualified to express these thoughts. Regardless I am here to share my story hoping I help at least one person.

I am in a stage in my learning where finding dedication is no longer an issue. I have a goal and at this point, I’ll do almost anything to achieve it. I sound pretty awesome, right? Well everyone knows that anything worth having in life is never easy to obtain, so my little self-declaration is far easier said than done.

So let's talk about one of the roadblocks I faced. Currently, I'm working on a vanilla Javascript project to show employers that I am familiar with how the technology works. Being that it's super important for any web developer to know it. That being said I hate javascript, and would much rather use Ract.js for most projects, but who wouldn't React.js just abstracts away so many tedious steps that vanilla javascript flaunts so proudly. So on top of having to use vanilla javascript, I decided to tackle a project that I was also pretty nervous about in general. I wanted to recreate the Apple Music UI with all the functionality included. SHEESH!

At my first crack at the project, I took a holistic approach, seeing the project not as individual components, but a single functional environment. For some circumstances, this might be the answer. NOT AS A PROGRAMMER. Even considering to take this approach overwhelmed me. I went straight to google trying to find a tutorial, but no one had a project quite like the UI I had envisioned. I was so eager to give up or to just select a different easier project. I couldn't let myself be beaten like this after saying I'll do anything to achieve my goal. 

My thinking had to change, I had to start thinking like programming. My job is to give the computer individual directions step by step to get the desired product. I had to break the concept into smaller pieces/components. Solving an individual problem at a time. How should I get the picture to show up on my app? After I solved that I checked it off my list. Great next todo how to add songs. You probably get the point by now. Don't look at an app you're trying to build as 1 problem, but rather many components that you have to solve and stack on top of each other. You as a person when it comes to your beliefs, your knowledge, your passions, and anything else that describes you was not built in at once, so why should your app?
